REQUIREMENTS
------------

 * A JVM.
 
 * Apache http server w. PHP 4.3 or 4.4 (make sure that XML support
   is enabled, see end for details). WERA will NOT work properly 
   with PHP 5, because of the new Object Model in PHP5. If PHP not 
   installed, the quickest solution may be to install XAMPP, 
   http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html

 * Tomcat servlet container
   (http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/index.html). 
   The arcretriever web app has been tested on v.5.0.27
   and 5.0.28 as well as in 5.5.9.

 * NutchWAX. A bundling of Nutch and extensions for searching 
   Web Archive Collections (WACs) 
   http://archive-access.sourceforge.net/projects/nutch/ 

   
THE NEXT STEPS
--------------
This installer will install the following:

 * WERA (PHP)
 * The ARC Retriever (Java webapp)
 
You will be asked to enter the directories in which to install the 
different components. 

For the installtion of the arcretriever you need to enter the webapp 
directory of your Tomcat installation. You will also be asked where 
yuor ARC files recide.

For the installation of WERA you need to enter the DocumentRoot
directory of your Apache installation (e.g. /usr/local/apache/htdocs or
/opt/lampp/htdocs). The installer will create the directory wera if you 
haven't created one on beforehand. The installer assumes that the wera 
directory is created in the web root and updates configuration files
accordingly. If you decide to install the gui further down in the 
directory structure you will need to manually edit the parameter 
$conf_http_host in the file lib/config.inc in order to get wera to work.

ADDITIONAL INFO
---------------
* PHP XML support:
  XML support is needed by WERA to handle the search results returned from 
  the nutchwax search engine. To verify that XML support is enabled in php 
  simply store the following text in a php-file (e.g. info.php) and save it 
  in the apache DocumentRoot directory 
  
  <?php
  phpinfo();
  ?> 
  
  Open up http://<yourhost>/info.php in a browser and check that PHP 
  has NOT been compiled with --disable-xml
