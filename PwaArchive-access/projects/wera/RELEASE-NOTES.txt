WERA Release Notes

CHANGES / NEW FEATURES
----------------------

v.0.2.2 :

  * Fixed bug 1277376, duplicate hits in result list 
    (http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1277376&group_id=118427&atid=681137)
  * WERA now uses NutchWAX's dedup functionality to supress duplicate hits in result list. Gives
    improved performance.

v.0.2.1 :

  * Support for nutchwax search engine added
  * Support for nwalucene search removed (replaced by the above)
  * Support for Fast Search Engine currently not working (will be added in later version)
  * Advanced search removed (may be added in later version)
  * New installer, java based. Works both in GUI mode and command line mode.
  * Server side link rewriting replaced by javascript client side link rewriting


Known issues
------------

  * Poor manual. Lots of information needs to be added.
  * When no X installed the Java based installer should fall back to console mode. 
    Some reports of problems with this. If so, install wera manually from wera-manual-install-x.y.z.tar.gz.
    Unpack and follow the instructions in the manual.
  * WERA does not work properly with PHP5. Has to do with PHP5's new Object Model. When using the 'NEAR' 
    mode of the documentLocator it will return a resultset concatenated by the resultsets for 'BEFORE' 
    and 'AFTER' instead of returning the one closest in time. Results in wrong aid to the 
    documentRetriever when presenting inline objects.
