= Introduction =

Misspellings lead IR systems to provide bad results without users even realizing their mistakes. Users assume that the system lacks quality, which decreases their satisfaction and likelihood of returning to the system. We detected the misspelling problem in the Portuguese Web Archive. Hence, we analyzed existing solutions for spelling suggestion and integrated the solution that provided the best results in our user interface.
