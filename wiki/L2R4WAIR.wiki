#summary Dataset to facilitate research in Learning to Rank for WAIR.

= Introduction =

Many of the information that was published on the web is no longer available online. It can only be found in web archives. Web archive information retrieval (WAIR) is a new and challenging research area that addresses the retrieval of document versions from web archives, according to a topical and temporal criteria of relevance. We release this dataset to facilitate research in Learning to Rank for WAIR (L2R4WAIR).


= Description =

The dataset is composed by a set of quadruples <query, version, grade, features>, where the grade indicates the degree of relevance of the version for the query. We use a three-level scale of relevance (not relevant, relevant and very relevant) converted to an integer scale ranging from 0 to 2. The document version is identified by URL and timestamp. The features represent a vector of feature values, each describing an estimate of relevance for the <query, version> pair.

The quadruples were obtained from the PWA9609 test collection available at http://code.google.com/p/pwa-technologies/wiki/TestCollection. 

We followed the file format used in LETOR datasets. Each of the following lines corresponds to a quadruple and represents one training example:

=============================================================
0 qid:21 1:0.10 2:0.233 3:0.611 ... 68:0.643 # id21968747index0
2 qid:21 1:0.70 2:0.344 3:0.221 ... 68:0.869 # id114746079index0
0 qid:22 1:0.05 2:0.112 3:0.118 ... 68:0.434 # id172346033index3
=============================================================

The first column is the relevance label. The second column is the query id, and the following 68 columns are the feature ids with their values. The last column, after the # symbol, is the version identifier.
