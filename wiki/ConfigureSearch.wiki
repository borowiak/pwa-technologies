#summary Configure indexing and searching parameters:


The configiration must be done before compiling, since the configuration files will be inside the JAR files.

== Step-by-step ==

Edit file pwa-technologies/PwaArchive-access/projects/nutchwax/conf/wax-default.xml

 * Change property _collection.type_: for the type of collection for indexing. This has implications mostly during the linkdb and index phases. There are three types of collections:
  ** normal - collection from one crawl. It will be handled as one snapshot, where a version is identified by a URL.
  ** multiple - collection from multiple crawls. It will be handled as multiple snapshots, where a version is identified by a URL and day.
  ** trec - collection from TREC (Text REtrieval Conference)

 * If selecting _multiple_ then database parameters must be configured to create virtual snapshots:
  ** Change property _database.conection_ (database connection): 
     e.g. //t2.tomba.fccn.pt/nutchwax
  ** Change property _database.username_ (database username): 
     e.g. nutchwax
  ** Change property _database.password_ (database password): 
     e.g. xxxxx
