= Introduction =

The PWACollection created to support research on web archive information retrieval (WAIS). It is composed by three parts: (1) a corpus representative of the documents' version encountered in a real search environment; (2) a set of topics describing users' information
needs; and (3) relevance judgments (a.k.a. qrels) indicating the degree of relevance of each document retrieved for each topic. 


= Corpus =

The corpus is composed by 6 collections of the Portuguese web, broadly considered the web subset of interest to the Portuguese. These collections are indexed and searchable through the public access given by the Portuguese Web Archive (PWA) at http://archive.pt.

In total, the corpus contain 255 million web pages' versions collected between 1996 and 2009. It amounts 6.2TB compressed in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARC_%28file_format%29 ARC file format] (8.9 TB uncompressed). The corpus' main characteristics are detailed in the following table.

|| *#* || Years || *Documents (K)* || *Size (GB)* || *Description* ||
|| 1 || 1996 || 75 || 0,316 || selective crawl of most popular sites ||
|| 2 ||1996 - 2000 || 5,047 || 48 || broad crawls periodically made by the Internet Archive ||
|| 3 || 2000 - 2008 || 118,842 || 1900 || broad crawls periodically made by the Internet Archive ||
|| 4 || 2004 - 2006 || 14,374 || 165 || selective crawls made by the Portuguese National Library ||
|| 5 || 2008 || 48,718 || 1600 || exhaustive crawl of mostly the .pt domain [http://sobre.arquivo.pt/sobre-o-arquivo/an-updated-portrait-of-the-portuguese-web]||
|| 6 || 2009 || 68,776 || 2500 || exhaustive crawl of mostly the .pt domain ||
|| || *TOTAL* || *255,832* || *6213* ||

This corpus includes all type of media formats (e.g. text, image, video and audio) and genres (e.g. news, blogs, wikis) to support future
IR tasks with dierent goals in mind.
