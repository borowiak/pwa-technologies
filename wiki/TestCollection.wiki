= Introduction =

The PWACollection was created to support research on web archive information retrieval (WAIS). It is composed by three parts: (1) a corpus representative of the documents' version encountered in a real search environment; (2) a set of topics describing users' information
needs; and (3) relevance judgments (a.k.a. qrels) indicating the degree of relevance of each document retrieved for each topic. 


= Corpus =

The corpus consists of 255 million web pages' versions collected between 1996 and 2009. It amounts 6.2TB compressed in ARC format (8.9 TB uncompressed). These versions are mainly from the Portuguese web and are searchable in http://archive.pt. The corpus' main characteristics are detailed in the following table.

|| *Year* || *Temperature (low)* || *Temperature (high)* ||
|| 1900 || -10 || 25 ||
|| 1910 || -15 || 30 ||
|| 1920 || -10 || 32 ||
|| 1930 || _N/A_ || _N/A_ ||
|| 1940 || -2 || 40 ||
