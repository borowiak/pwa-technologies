The PWACollection was created to support research on web archive information retrieval (WAIS). It is composed by three parts: (1) a corpus representative of the documents' version encountered in a real search environment; (2) a set of topics describing users' information
needs; and (3) relevance judgments (a.k.a. qrels) indicating the degree of relevance of each document retrieved for each topic.
